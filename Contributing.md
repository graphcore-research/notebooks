# Contributing notebooks

These instructions are intended for members of the Graphcore Research team.

**Before pushing to a branch:**

 - Is your work ready for sharing? (If in doubt, ask the head of Research.)
 - Did you write all the code, or have you clearly attributed the author?
   - Are all code and dependencies permissively licensed?
 - Check through that there are no references to unreleased products or customers (including in any git history).

**Reviewing a PR**

 - Passes standard IP review?
 - New notebooks added to README.md?
 - Once you're happy, "approve" and let the submitter merge the PR.
